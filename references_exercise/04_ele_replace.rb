# Write a method, ele_replace!(array, hash), that accepts an array and a hash as args.
# The method should mutate the given array by replacing elements with their corresponding values in the hash.
# The method should return the given array.
#
# Note: this method must MUTATE the input array. This means that the object_id of the input array should be identical
# to the object_id of the returned array. The exact object_ids you get back don't matter. We just want the ids
# to be the same before and after calling your method.

        if hash.has_key?(ele) #hash contains a key thats also in the array arr = [4,2,0,2]  vs  hash = {2=>two, 0 => zero} 
            hash[ele] #convert array values with corresponding hash values -> [ ... ,two,zero,two]
        else
            ele #if array value doesnt correspond with hash key, place array index back to original position -> [ 4,...,...,...]
